# Bubblebook
Bubblebook is a mini-game, taking a light-hearted look at the phenomenon of "filter bubbles", described by Wikipedia as "...a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history." This game was created in response to a university application task.
